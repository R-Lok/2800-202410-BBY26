## Installation
section contains ordered instructions so a new developer can assemble a DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT to contribute, including a list of tools, versions, and configuration instructions, if any. A separate plaintext file contains ids and passwords.

## Features
an easy-to-find labeled section tells us how to use the app and includes a helpful list of features and how to use them.

## Credits
a labeled section provides an organized list of credits, references, and licenses (if you have any). This is where you include a list of all the websites that had helpful code you used in your app. Remember to provide credit where credit is due!

## AI Usage
Did you use AI to help create your app? If so, how? Be specific. [2 marks]
- We used AI to generate the logo for the application - Microsoft Copilot
- We used AI to understand documentation throughout the development process.
- We used AI to get some ideas on how to approach certain coding problems e.g. "does this functionality I'm thinking of already exist in native JavaScript?". We never just copied and pasted code.
- We used AI at times to help debug our code to see what we were doing wrong (e.g backend errors)
Did you use AI to create data sets or clean data sets? If so, how? Be specific. [ 2 marks]
- No we did not, all mock data was generated by ourselves.
Does your app use AI? If so, how? Be specific. [ 2 marks]
- Yes, the flashcard generation calls on the openai API for GPT-4o model for generating flashcards from text and images.
- GPT4o analyses the text/image and returns flashcard data to the server.
Did you encounter any limitations? What were they, and how did you overcome them? Be specific. [ 2 marks]
- Sometimes when asking AI coding related questions, it does not have enough context on the project to provide an answer suitable for our situation. We overcame this by making sure we include the most important contextual details when prompting.
